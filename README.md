# Instructions

We would like you to work on this coding test so we can see how you would approach building out this feature. We think you should spend less than 2 hours on the code test. It's fine if you don't complete all requirements, we are more interested in your approach than a complete solution.
​

## User Story to Implement

As a user of SiSU Car Management platform, I would like to see a list of cars that can be searched by name and sorted by name/price/vendor.
​
Tip: Input from users could be a simple Web UI, or CLI input.
​

## More Information

We value writing well design structure and well tested code at SiSU and would like to see tests around any code you write.
​
Preferred programming language is JavaScript, but not compulsory.
​
Feel free to send through any questions you may have.
